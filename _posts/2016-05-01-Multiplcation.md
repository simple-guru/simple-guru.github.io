title: Multiplication of 2 numbers
---

Back in the 90's when I was a kid I clocked 0.05sec for multiplying two numbers for which I won the national award. I was faster than the so called powerful computers at that time;). I still hold the record for the same. People say that these days computers are much powerful and can do computations trillion times faster than us. So I decided to challenge these "Mighty" computers.

> Challenge the "Mighty" computers

Lets set the competation rules right.

{% highlight text %}
result = a * b
Given the "result" and "a" , Find "b".
{% endhighlight %}

I know that the computers are smart. Unfortunately we are not supposed to use addition/division to solve this.

>Note: Addition/Substraction/Division cannot be used.
example: 
   b= result/a; is not allowed
