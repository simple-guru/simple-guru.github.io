> Imagine building a computer using a switch!!!

Thats totally absurd.How can you build a computer using a switch!! Impossible!!
Hmmm.....
May be it is possible to build one....

Lets work out the math.
A [switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch) is a simple mechanism of controlling the flow between 2 ends.In order to build a computer you need basic logic gates.(Recall Electronics 101 The [AND](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s and the [OR](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s and the [NOT](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s).Thats the holy grail!!
If you can build these gates may be we inch towards the massive goal.

GREAT!!!Lets get started then.

How do we build one?
Lets start with [AND](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates). The logic AND outputs high if all the inputs are high.

    ....! ....! ....
    .              .     AND using Switches
    .......`O`......
    
> Imagine those ! symbols as switches.`0` is our Glowy BULB

If one of the switch is closed the bulb will not glow. The Bulb Glows only when both switches are closed.So we have our AND gate ready. Great going!!!

Transistor is the biggest innovation of 19th century.Simple yet powerful revolutionised the way we go about doing things everyday.I find it difficult to name something that is not influenced by this liitle piece of marvel.Something ranging from a simple watch to satellite are built using this tiny little transistors. 

> In Plain English Transistor is nothing more than a switch, an automatic switch.

To put it very simple words all transistor is doing is what a switch does. A switch is a perfect analogy for understaning the working of a transistor.


It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
