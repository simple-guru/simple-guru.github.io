title: Electronically controlled switch a.k.a. "Transistor"!!!
---

Transistor is the biggest innovation of 19th century.Simple yet powerful revolutionised the way we go about doing things everyday.I find it difficult to name something that is not influenced by this liitle piece of marvel.Something ranging from a simple watch to satellite are built using this tiny little transistors. 

> In Plain English Transistor is nothing more than a switch, an automatic switch.

To put it very simple words all transistor is doing is what a switch does. A switch is a perfect analogy for understaning the working of a transistor.


It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
