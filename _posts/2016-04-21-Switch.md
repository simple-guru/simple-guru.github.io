> Imagine building a computer using a switch!!!

Thats totally absurd.How can you build a computer using a switch!! Impossible!!
Hmmm.....
May be it is possible to build one....

Lets work out the math.
A [switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch) is a simple mechanism of controlling the flow between 2 ends.In order to build a computer you need basic logic gates.(Recall Electronics 101 The [AND](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s and the [OR](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s and the [NOT](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s).Thats the holy grail!!
If you can build these gates may be we inch towards the massive goal.

GREAT!!!Lets get started then.

How do we build one?
Lets start with [AND](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates). The logic AND outputs high if all the inputs are high.

    ....! ....! ....
   ___              .
    -              .
    .......`O`......
    
    AND using Switches
    
 Imagine those ! symbols as switches.`0` is our Glowy BULB.[Stop thinking of it as birthday cake]

{% endhighlight %}
If one of the switch is closed the bulb will not glow. The Bulb Glows only when both switches are closed.So we have our AND gate ready. Great going!!!

The [OR](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates).
The logic OR outputs high if any of its inout is high.

       ....! ....
       .        .
    ....        .......
    .  .        .     .
    .  ....! ....     .
   ___               `O`
    -                 .
    ...................
    
    OR using Switches

{% endhighlight %}

Even if one of the switch is closed the bulb glows.We have our OR.

The naughty [NOT](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates):
you say high i say low, I say low you say high.....

![NOT](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/boolean/boo11.gif?81223b)    
    
    NOT using Switches

### Here is the logical way of representing the logic gates.

Now that we have all our ingredients ready, we can cook our meth now.

Next up, Lets add some numbers.

![Full Adder](http://www.waitingforfriday.com/images/8/83/Slide10.PNG) 

I am sure all the electronics 101 bells are ringing now!!!
Nothing fancy. Just work out the math.

<i>Lets ask a simple question. How Fast the above switch adder circuit can add numbers?</i>
{% highlight text %}

It depends on how fast one turns the switches on and off.
The faster the switches are turned on/off the faster the results.

{% endhighlight %}

If at all computers were built using switches it would be extremely slow.Imagine the speed being measured in how fast you turn those switches on and off manually. This is where you put on the engineers cap and say I am an engineer.Just kidding :)

>The question we need to ask is "Is there any other way we can turn these switches on/off very fast?"

BRAVO!!!Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley shocked the world with an electronically controlled switch aka [TRANSISTOR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY).
All transistor is nothing more than an electronically controlled switch with which we can build all the logic gates using these transistors.

The Logic gates to the Flipflops to Shift Registers to adder circuts to the MUX to the DEmux to Micro Controllers to the memories to the i/o 's , are all built using these tiny switches.



I know what you are thinking.Are we ever going to build the mighty computer?We will get there sooon.Relax ;)

>Its about the journey, Not the Destination.Enjoy the ride!!!
