> Imagine building a computer using a switch!!!

Thats totally absurd.How can you build a computer using a switch!! Impossible!!
Hmmm.....
May be it is possible to build one....

Lets work out the math.
A [switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch) is a simple mechanism of controlling the flow between 2 ends.In order to build a computer you need basic logic gates.(Recall Electronics 101 The [AND](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s and the [OR](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s and the [NOT](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates)'s).Thats the holy grail!!
If you can build these gates may be we inch towards the massive goal.

GREAT!!!Lets get started then.

How do we build one?
Lets start with [AND](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates). The logic AND outputs high if all the inputs are high.

    ....! ....! ....
   ___              .
    -              .
    .......`O`......
    
    AND using Switches
    
 Imagine those ! symbols as switches.`0` is our Glowy BULB.[Stop thinking of it as birthday cake]

{% endhighlight %}
If one of the switch is closed the bulb will not glow. The Bulb Glows only when both switches are closed.So we have our AND gate ready. Great going!!!

The [OR](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates).
The logic OR outputs high if any of its inout is high.

{% highlight text %}

       ....! ....
       .        .
    ....        .......
    .  .        .     .
    .  ....! ....     .
   ___               `O`
    -                 .
    ...................
    
    OR using Switches

{% endhighlight %}

Even if one of the switch is closed the bulb glows.We have our OR.

The naughty [NOT](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics/Basic_gates):
you say high i say low, I say low you say high.....

    NOT using Switches

Here is the logical way of representing the logic gates.

Now that we all out ingredients ready, we can cook our meth now.

Next up, Lets use these to build an adder circuit.

Nothing fancy. Just work out the math.I am sure all the electronics 101 bells are ringing now!!!




I know what you are thinking.Where the hell is the computer?

We will get there.
>Its about the journey, Not the Destination.Enjoy the ride!!!
